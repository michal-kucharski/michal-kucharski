- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m MichaÅ‚ Kucharski
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in FrontEnd Development and soon would like to jump into Backend.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Vue.js and basics of Node.js
- :desktop_computer: I'm looking for a job where I can work with more experienced developers to learn and grow my skills. 
In my dream job I would like to work with JavaScript and Vue most of the time, and get feedback from colleagues.
